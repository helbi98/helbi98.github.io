									<h2><br />Traditional Machine Learning Algorithms for Bone Tumor Treatment Prediction: A comprehensive performance assessment</h2>
									<p> International Journal of Engineering Research & Technology (IJERT), Vol. 13 Issue 5, May 2024</p>

								<p>Bone tumor refers to unusual growth of cells in the 
									skeletal system, characterized by varying degrees of 
									aggressiveness and clinical indications. Handling these tumors 
									presents significant challenges due to their complex 
									characteristics and case specific factors. Typical approaches to 
									bone tumor treatment, including surgery, radiation therapy, and 
									chemotherapy depend on factors such as tumor type, position, 
									and stage. Despite advances in technology and medical treatment, 
									achieving individualized, fast opinion, and affordable treatment 
									options remain grueling. This highlights the necessity for 
									innovative strategies. Recently, machine learning algorithms have 
									emerged as important tools in oncology, offering advancements 
									in diagnostic accuracy, prognostic assessment, and treatment 
									decision-making. This paper aims to identify the most effective 
									traditional machine learning algorithm for prognosticating bone 
									tumor treatment.</p>
								<p>The competence of algorithms such as logistic 
									regression, decision trees, support vector machines, random 
									forests, and k-nearest neighbors in predicting treatment 
									pathways was assessed using clinical datasets. Random Forest 
									demonstrated superior performance among all algorithms, 
									achieving the top notch values for performance criteria. 
									Whereas, Na√Øve Bayes exhibited comparatively poor 
									performance. Machine learning algorithms offer a rapid as well 
									as case-specific method for bone tumor treatment prediction. 
									Through the development of a prognostic system derived from 
									this study, future endeavors can shape individualized treatment 
									strategies for individuals with bone tumors, potentially leading to 
									further cost effective therapy.</p>
